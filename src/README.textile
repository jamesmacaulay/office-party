h1. Office Party

An iTunes web UI built with Rails & Shoes, cooked up by "James MacAulay":http://jmacaulay.net.

h4. You need

"OS X":http://www.apple.com/macosx/

Hopefully will be working on Windows sometime soon.

h4. Installation and usage

Mount office_party.dmg (found in ./bin) and drag OfficeParty.app to your Applications folder (or anywhere, really) and start it up.

Shoes downloads itself automatically if you don't already have it, along with the necessary rubygems. The app's databases and logs are stored in @~/.office_party@ .

After launching the app, you get a scrolling log window and a script/console window. Then hit "this guy":http://localhost:3000/itunes/playpause a bunch of times and be amazed!

h4. Things you should be able to do, but can't for some reason

* Run it in Windows: it freezes at "Booting WEBrick..."

h4. Things to come

Maybe something other than just a few controller actions...?

Right now this is really just an overly-cumbersome wrapper around Kai Steinbach's rb-itunes; something like this, as it is right now, would really have been better made with e.g. Sinatra over Rails. But I plan on turning Office Party into a bigger project over time, so I'm using Rails and that's that.
